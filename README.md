# Task-2 Identify Error - Header Responsive

This is task-2 in which I had to identify mistakes in the existing code and make the header responsive. 
I have separated all parts into different files: the CSS part is in style.css, the Javascript part is in script.js. and I have created an Assets folder for the logo image. 
I have made the header responsive using media queries.
